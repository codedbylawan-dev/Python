# üìò Day 2 ‚Äî Variables and Data Types

**Date:** October 26, 2025

---

## üéØ Focus

To understand what **variables** and **data types** are in Python, how to **store values**, and identify different **types of data** that can be used in a program.

---

## üß† Goal

Learn how to **declare and assign variables**, understand **data types** like String, Integer, Float, and Boolean, and know how to use them effectively in Python programs.

---

## üìù Topics Covered

### 1. Variables

- Variables are like **containers** for storing information (values).
- The values stored in variables **can be changed** at any time.

```python
age = 25
name = "Lawan"
```

Here,

- `age` stores the number `25`
- `name` stores the text `"Lawan"`

---

### 2. Values

In programming, the **information** stored in a variable is called a **value**.
Think of it like placing something inside a labeled box ‚Äî the label is the **variable name**, and the content is the **value**.

Example:

```python
language = "Python"
```

Here, `"Python"` is the **value** stored in the variable `language`.

---

### 3. Data Type

Every value in Python has a specific **type**, known as a **data type**.
The data type defines **what kind of operations** can be performed on that data.

Example:

- Mathematical operations ‚Üí can be done on **Integer** and **Float** types
- Text manipulation ‚Üí can be done on **String** type

Common Python data types:

| Data Type   | Description                      | Example   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | --------- |
| **String**  | Sequence of characters           | `"Hello"` |
| **Integer** | Whole number (no decimal)        | `10`      |
| **Float**   | Number with decimal point        | `12.5`    |
| **Boolean** | Logical value (`True` / `False`) | `True`    |

---

### 4. String

A **String** is a **sequence of characters** enclosed in **quotes**.
It can include:

- Capital letters (A‚ÄìZ)
- Small letters (a‚Äìz)
- Digits (0‚Äì9)
- Special characters (~ ! @ # $ % ^ & . ? ,)
- Spaces

Examples:

```python
"Hello World!"
"some@example.com"
"1234"
'hello'
"hello"
```

> ‚úÖ **Note:** Strings can be enclosed in either **single (' ')** or **double (" ")** quotes.

---

### 5. Integer

An **Integer** represents all **whole numbers**, including positive, negative, and zero.
It does **not** include any decimal or fractional part.

Examples:

```
... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...
```

```python
x = 10
y = -25
```

---

### 6. Float

A **Float** represents any number with a **decimal point**.

Examples:

```python
pi = 3.14
temperature = -27.5
marks = 92.0
```

---

### 7. Boolean

A **Boolean** represents one of two possible values:
‚úÖ **True** or ‚ùå **False**

In Python, these values must start with a **capital letter**.

Examples:

```python
is_logged_in = True
is_verified = False
```

Booleans are used for **conditions**, **comparisons**, and **logic** (like Yes/No, 0/1, On/Off).

---

### 8. Assigning Values to Variables

Use the **assignment operator (`=`)** to store a value in a variable.

**Syntax:**

```python
variable_name = value
```

Example:

```python
age = 10
```

Here,

- `age` is the variable name
- `10` is the value
- `=` is the **assignment operator**, used to assign the value to the variable

---

**Question:**
What symbol is used to assign a value to a variable in Python?
‚úÖ **Answer:** `=` (Assignment Operator)

---

## üìö Learned Concepts

- A **variable** is a container that stores a **value**.
- Every value has a **data type** that defines how it can be used.
- **Strings** are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes.
- **Integers** are whole numbers without decimals.
- **Floats** are numbers with decimal points.
- **Booleans** represent truth values ‚Äî `True` or `False`.
- The **assignment operator (`=`)** is used to assign a value to a variable.
