## 🧠 Approach

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find the **product** of three numbers — 37, 61, and 391.
The word _product_ means the result of multiplying numbers together.
So, we’ll calculate:

```
37 × 61 × 391
```

---

### **Step 2: Write the Program**

We can multiply the three numbers directly and store the result in a variable.
Then, we’ll print it using the `print()` function.

```python
result = 37 * 61 * 391
print(result)
```
